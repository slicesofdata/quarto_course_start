This course consists of various content modules that introduce students to data visualization techniques using R. Techniques, however, should not be applied haphazardly but instead with respect to the biological and cognitive limitations of the user. The general principles of data visualization taught can be applied to programming languages other than R (e.g., Python, D3, etc.).

## Module structure

In general, modules will contain readings, additional resources, and weekly assignments.

The modules will be updated across the semester as needed. There are more modules on this course site because some modules provide other useful information. The names of the modules listed in the syllabus, however, do match the names in the module listing.
